# {{ page.title }}

The **CBU Series** stands for cluster bomb units. They release smaller submunitions designed to kill personnel, destroy vehicles, scatter landmines or cause infrastructure damage. Because cluster bombs release many small bomblets over a wide area, they pose risks to civilians both during attacks and afterwards. Unexploded bomblets can kill or maim civilians and/or unintended targets long after a conflict has ended, and are costly to locate and remove.
