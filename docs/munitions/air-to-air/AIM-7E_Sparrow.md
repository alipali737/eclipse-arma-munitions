# {{ page.title }}

The **AIM-7E Sparrow** is a medium-range, semi-active radar homing air-to-air missile. The missile has a 1.8s tracking delay after launch and 2.7s to become fully maneuverable. The semi-active radar homing system means that a target can be selected within the radar but the rocket will then use the active radar system of its target to track it. It is capable of destroying fighter-sized aircraft with a single hit in most cases.
